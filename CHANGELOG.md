## 1.1.0, 2026-09-26

- Exit codes follow the house contract, so a script branches the same way on every one of these CLIs: 0 ok, 2 typed wrong or a refused write, 3 not found, 4 macOS refused access (Full Disk Access, or Automation for Photos), 5 the engine or Photos failed, 10 the engine could not start. Before, everything that was not a typing mistake exited 1.
- SKILL.md carries the exit-code table.
- Releases come from `publish.yml` on a tag. The Claude Desktop extension is attached to each release.

## 1.0.4, 2026-09-03

Fixes found by a full review of the TypeScript surface.

- `look_at_photos` returned captions and no pictures. The bridge kept only text content parts, so the one tool whose purpose is seeing deleted every image before it reached the caller.
- Engine failures were reported as success. The Python returns its errors as an ordinary value, which the protocol marks `isError: false`, so a failed export exited 0 with the error on stdout and `export-originals ... && rm ...` would carry on.
- A crashed engine bricked the session. The dead client stayed cached, so every later call failed with "Connection closed" for the life of the process.
- The engine's stderr was piped and never read, which threw away the real cause of a failure and could block the child once the buffer filled.
- Timeouts were the protocol default of 60s, which a cold `uv` run and any real export both exceed.
- `uv run` now passes `--no-project`, so it stops trying to sync whatever project the client happened to be started in.
- `--refs` accepts several bare arguments: `photo-info uuid1 uuid2` used to be an error.
- Empty strings reach the engine, so a title or description can be cleared.
- `which` maps this library's vocabulary; "save my photos to disk" now answers `export-originals` rather than four browsing tools.
- Removed `login` and `capture` from the command list, and the Midjourney flag aliases and synonyms behind them. None of it existed here.
- `limit` caps at 100 and `size` at 128-2048, matching the engine instead of advertising ceilings it silently clamped. `photo_info` and `export_originals` say where they truncate.
- `export_originals` is a read: it copies files out without changing the library, which is why the engine offers it under read-only.
- `doctor` told users to set `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_LIBRARY`, which nothing reads. It is `APPLE_PHOTOS_LIBRARY`.
- Boolean environment variables are an allowlist on both sides, so `READ_ONLY=enabled` cannot mean read-only in one layer and read-write in the other.

## 1.0.2, 2026-09-02

- TypeScript MCP server and CLI over the Python engine, published as `@thenavidm/apple-photos-mcp-cli`. `npx` with no toolchain to install first, and every tool is also a shell command.
- The tool array is exported, so the HQ connector imports it rather than listing tools by hand. That route had drifted to 11 of 13, missing `library_stats` and `look_at_photos`, which meant a model estimated library totals from keyword samples and recommended photos it had never seen.
- A test asserts the TypeScript and Python tool lists match exactly.
- Python stays the engine: `osxphotos` and `photoscript` are the only libraries that can read a Photos library, and both are Python-only.
- Installs on any platform so tooling can read the schemas, and refuses to run anywhere but macOS with a message saying why.
- TypeScript output lives in `lib/`, not `dist/`. Python packaging leaves a `dist/.gitignore` containing `*`, which silently emptied the npm tarball.

## 0.1.0, 2026-09-01

First release.

Searches Apple's own on-device machine learning index rather than filenames and
typed metadata: scene labels, text read out of images, activities, venue types
and reverse geocoded places. Verified against a 37,129 item library where only
3 items had a title and 3 had keywords, but 35,983 carried scene labels and
10,852 carried readable text.

Ranking is tuned against the failure that matters. A screenshot full of OCR text
otherwise matches almost any query, so matches resting only on text found inside
an image are scored down, and screenshots compete at a discount unless the query
is asking for one.

Words Apple has no concept of come back in `unmatched_terms` with suggestions
from the vocabulary that does exist, instead of silently returning noise.

`look_at_photos` renders from Apple's cached derivatives rather than the
original, so previews work for assets that live only in iCloud. In the test
library 36,996 of 37,129 assets had no local original and every preview still
rendered.

Writes work by default. `archive_photos` requires `confirm: true`.
`APPLE_PHOTOS_READ_ONLY=1` removes the write tools from the list entirely.
